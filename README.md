# Python_scripting 🐍

 A collection of Python scripts demonstrating data-manipulation skills: working with lists/strings/files, using iteration, conditionals, functions, regex, and built-in modules to parse and transform data.

## ✅ What is this 🔍

```
This repository houses several Python (Jupyter) scripts that illustrate foundational data-processing techniques, including:

- Iterative and conditional logic  
- User-defined functions and return values  
- List, string, and file operations  
- Regex-based pattern matching and text processing  
- Use of core Python modules (e.g. `re`, `stat`, file I/O)  
- Importing data from various formats and transforming/parsing into structured output  

It’s not a full “application” or library yet — rather a sandbox / learning ground showing how to manipulate data in different ways.
I am currently working on Numpy library after which I will tackle pandas as both libraries are the core of my skills as a data analyst
I also plan on building full projects off of real data sets with both once my proficiency at both increases.

### 📂 Contents & Description of Scripts

**iterative_conditional_userdef_return_functions.ipynb** -- https://github.com/dareoyeleke/python_scripting/blob/main/iterative_conditional_userdef_return_functions.ipynb
-  This notebook demonstrates how to combine loops (iteration), conditional logic, and custom (user-defined) functions in Python — with a focus on functions that return values. It’s a hands-on walk-through of fundamental programming constructs: iterating through data structures, applying conditional logic, encapsulating logic into reusable functions, and producing outputs via return statements.

**operators_two.ipynb** -- https://github.com/dareoyeleke/python_scripting/blob/main/operators.ipynb
-  This notebook provides an overview and examples of the various built-in operators in Python. It demonstrates how to use arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment (including augmented assignment), bitwise, identity, and membership operators. The aim is to give readers a solid grounding in how different operators behave and how they can be combined to write expressive, correct Python code.

**split_join_lists_statmodule_methods.ipynb** -- https://github.com/dareoyeleke/python_scripting/blob/main/split_join_lists_statmodule_methods.ipynb
-  This notebook demonstrates how to use string methods (like .split() and .join()), list manipulations, and the built-in statistics module to process and analyze data collections. It shows how to convert between strings and lists, clean or transform data, and apply simple statistical summaries — combining fundamental programming tools for practical data-handling workflows.

**with_open_regex.ipynb** --  https://github.com/dareoyeleke/python_scripting/blob/main/with_open_regex.ipynb
-  This notebook demonstrates how to read from and write to text files using Python’s with open(...) syntax, and how to use regular expressions (via the re module) to parse, search, or transform text data. It shows how to combine file I/O and pattern-matching to process semi-structured or unstructured text — for example, extracting particular patterns, filtering lines, or cleaning data.

**extlibrary_classes.ipynb** 📦 --  https://github.com/dareoyeleke/python_scripting/blob/main/extlibrary_classes.ipynb
-  This notebook showcases usage of external Python libraries (beyond the standard library) and demonstrates how to organize code using classes (object-oriented programming). It’s intended to move beyond basic scripts toward more structured, modular, and reusable code — illustrating how libraries and custom classes can be leveraged for cleaner, maintainable workflows.

**Numpy_1_.ipynb** --  https://github.com/dareoyeleke/python_scripting/blob/main/Numpy_1_.ipynb
-  This notebook serves as an introduction to NumPy and showcases foundational usage of NumPy arrays — how to create arrays, manipulate them, and leverage NumPy’s advantages over Python native lists for numerical and array-based data.

**Numpy_2.ipynb**  --  https://github.com/dareoyeleke/python_scripting/blob/main/Numpy_2.ipynb
-  This notebook builds on the basics and delves into more advanced NumPy features — showing how to apply complex operations, transformations, and possibly multi-dimensional data manipulations using NumPy’s full capabilities.

**Numpy_3.ipynb** -- https://github.com/dareoyeleke/python_scripting/blob/main/Numpy_3.ipynb
-  This notebook goes beyond the basics of array creation and simple operations, exploring more advanced numerical, statistical, linear-algebraic, and array-manipulation features provided by NumPy. It aims to show how NumPy can be used in more complex workflows: data transformations, matrix computations, random data generation, and efficient array-wide operations — helping you treat numeric data and matrices in real-world applications such as scientific computing, data analysis, or simulation.

**lamda_dict.ipynb** 📚 -- https://github.com/dareoyeleke/python_scripting/blob/main/lamda_dict.ipynb
-  This notebook explores how to use anonymous (lambda) functions together with dictionaries and other basic data-structures in Python. It illustrates how lambda expressions can be stored in dictionaries, used for quick functional behavior (e.g. dynamic selection of functions), and combined with common built-in operations to manipulate or transform data. The goal is to demonstrate idiomatic Python patterns using lambdas and dicts as tools for concise, flexible code.


## How to Use / Requirements⚙️

**Clone the repo:**

-  git clone https://github.com/dareoyeleke/python_scripting.git


-  Install dependencies (if any). At minimum you need Python; for notebooks using external libraries such as NumPy,  install them, e.g.:

-  pip install numpy


-  🚀 Open the .ipynb files in a Jupyter environment (e.g. Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, VSCode with notebook support) and run the cells to view and experiment with the code. 

## Purpose & Audience

-  This repository is intended for:

-  Developers practicing Python fundamentals — algorithms, data structures, file I/O, regex, array handling.

-  Learners wanting clear, runnable examples for common data manipulation tasks.

-  Anyone interested in seeing how basic Python tools (built-ins, regex, file I/O, NumPy) can be combined for real-world-style data processing scripts.
